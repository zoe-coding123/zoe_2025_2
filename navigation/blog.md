## Sprint 4 Final Review

### Planning

I brainstormed with my other team members our ideas for our changes and helped make an issue with some pictures and a little text of the ideas.

### Coded/Changed
Working/trying stuff with the game definitely did help me learn more, or at least about problem shooting/fixing bugs. My task was to change the npc sprite. Although my original goal was to actually the player sprite, I discovered that changing the player sprite was more complicated and connected to more things than some of the other sprites. I could probably still learn more about it, but because of that I ended up deciding to change one of the npc sprites. It introduced me to code about frames which is something I hadn't really dealt with before and learned a bit about. I successfully changed the sprite and was able to make it so that it was touching the ground and not floating. I also was the one who made the pull request.

### Studied
I learned about working together in groups and the agile process. I also learned a bit about changing sprites and user stories. I also had started looking into how to add requirements like having to collect all the coins in the level first before being able to go to the next level.

### Mistakes
When trying to change the player sprite and when trying to change the level ending to require collecting all the coins, some changes when I tested it locally seemed to break the game, or have some aspect not work properly. Also when making the pull request and it having a lot of old commits that weren't part of our level changes and seemed like it would cause a merge conflict if it was accepted. I also probably could've collaborated a bit more but I did try to talk to and communicate with the rest of the team.

### Highlights
- helped figure out branch configuration so doing git pull would update each person's own branch
- researched a bit and tried to figure out/trouble shoot issues that came up
- helping with integration by creating pull request

### General Reflection
I'm pretty sure there's still plenty of things I need to learn/don't know but I do feel I've learned from interacting and trying to change the game. It helped give me a better understanding of game code and how it's organized.

## Personal Journal

1/14/25

Me and my other team members each have notebook for our help system. Currently we're trying to solve an issue where we can't see one of our team member's notebooks. I learned a bit about branches but were still struggling with fixing the issue even after trying to merge his branch with the main branch. I helped fix an error that showed up when trying to merge the branches that I had previously gotten myself.
But we still can't see his notebook.

Earlier today I made a pull request for our help system notebooks, but I couldn't include Kian's notebook because I still couldn't see it.
We have done a bit more planning and now have more of an idea of what we are going to try to do.
