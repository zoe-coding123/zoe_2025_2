    "# 5 Things I've Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "### Software Development\n",
    "\n",
    "I've learned about how multiple people would be able to work on the same code project. I've learned a bit about how forks and branches work, as well as now having tried live share. I talk about forking and branches in my software development cycle blog.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a href=\"https://zoe-coding123.github.io/zoe_2025_2/final%20review/college%20articulation%20blogs/2025/03/03/software-development-lifecycle_IPYNB_2_.html\">Software Development LifeCycle</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Planning\n",
    "\n",
    "I've learned more about how to plan out what things I want to accomplish with my goals. I think its something I could still work on. I've learned about the concept of burndown lists and have made some checklist issues. I think at times I spend too much time dwelling on the planning rather than starting and trying to do things with my code. I'm usually slow in my work as well so I need to work on planning out my schedule, and figuring out a better idea of what are reasonable goals for myself, as I feel like the things I usually want to do are unrealistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### OOP Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "Another things I've learned about is OOP class relationships. I think I had possibly heard of inheritence before but now I think I understand at least the basic concepts better. I also learned about draw.io and how to make an OOP diagram and what one is supposed to look like. I talk about this in my classes blog.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a href=\"https://zoe-coding123.github.io/zoe_2025_2/final%20review/college%20articulation%20blogs/2025/02/03/classes_IPYNB_2_.html\">Classes</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coding Collaboration\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborating with others for a bigger coding project was something new I hadn't really done before. I learned a bit about the process like a bit on what AGILE is, and having to plan and split up tasks. I also learned about the live share feature, and that you can all work on the same repository and see each others edits. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning from Game Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "I think after working with adventureGame and maybe even platformer_4x before, I feel like I'm actually starting to understand the code a little better. I don't know if I could say I understand everything, but I think it helped kind of see how it actually works. Besides learning about class relationships like I've previously mentioned, I also learned a bit about instances and ended up getting exposure to the map function and forEach function, which I show at the end of my blog on control structures.\n",
