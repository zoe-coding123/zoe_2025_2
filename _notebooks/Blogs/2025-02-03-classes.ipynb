    "This is a class diagram of adventureGame. This version is the one that contains my personal changes to the original. Diagrams like this model the relationships between different classes. The top section of a box contains the key properties it has. The bottom half of a box shows all the methods a class has. The arrows between boxes represent is a and has a relationships. The arrows with an open arrow head represent inheritence. The class the arrow points to is the class the other is inheriting from. When a class is extended from another class, it inherits all its properties and methods. These would also model is a relationships. For example, Character is a GameObject. The other arrows with a filled in arrow head are for has a relationships. They represent if a class has objects/instances of another class in it. For example, GameEnv has GameObjects it it.\n",

    "## Instantiating Objects\n",
    "Instantiation is the process of creating an object from a class using a constructor method. The constructor initializes object attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Objects\n",
    "Once an object has been instantiated, you can access or modify the object’s attributes or call the object’s methods to perform actions or retrieve information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods\n",
    "Methods are functions defined within a class that operate on the data (attributes) of an object.\n",
    "Methods can modify object state, perform calculations or operations, and return values\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calling Methods\n",
    "- To call a method on an object (in JavaScript), use the object’s name followed by a dot (.), the method name, and parentheses.\n",
    "- Pass any required arguments (parameters) inside the parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parameters\n",
    "Methods can take inputs called parameters (or arguments) to process data or customize behavior.\n",
    "When calling a method, parameters are passed to the method by placing them within the parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Return Values\n",
    "Methods can produce and transmit results from calculations or operations to the caller for further use via return values. The methods “return values.”\n"
