    "| Work Habits    | [N]            | 3            | 0.85   | I still need to work on making time and staying on schedule with my work.   |\n",

    "| Timeliness     | [N]            | 3            | 0.85   | This is something I'm aware that I need to improve and have been trying to work on. I believe I've started to make slight improvement now towards the end of the tri but now its ending.|\n",
    "| Tech Sense     | [N]            | 2            | 0.75   | I think its improved but I think I could still improve my foundational understanding as well as having a more detailed understanding of the concepts we've been using. |\n",
    "| Tech Talk      | [N]            | 2            | 0.75   | I still find I'm not the best at explaining, I think this is something that will improve as I improve my understanding/tech sense. I'm also trying to be more confident in what I say and present. |\n",
    "| Tech Growth    | [N]            | 4           | 0.90   | I definitely think I know more now than I did at the beginning of the trimester. And I feel after trying things with the code I'm starting to understand it better. |\n",
    "| Advocacy       | [N]            | 3            | 0.85   | This is something I could still improve, but I've made a few attempts to ask questions. I've gotten more outside help from a tutor and my dad.  |\n",
    "| Comm & Collab  | [N]            | 3            | 0.85  | I know I could still work on improving my communication and collaboration. I know I could still probably branch out more to talk to others. I did try my best to communicate and work with my group when we were working on the platformer game.   |\n",

    "| Organized      | [N]            | 4            | 0.90   | I think my organization hasn't been too bad but I probably could still fix some of my categories on old blogs. Maybe I could put more links on my page.       |\n",

I wanted to do a bit more and its functionality might be a bit unconventional, but I did make multiple changes to the code and had to do a lot of troubleshooting.        |\n",

My draw.io diagram might still also a bit more arrows than necessary, but I did try to just get it down to arrows for inheritance and has a relationships.         |\n",
    "| College Articulation Blogs | [N] | 2 | 0.75 | I have blogs on the different topics but some of them could be more complete with more explanation. Some of them I'm also not sure if they're too generalized. Some could use some more examples. |\n",
    "| N@TM feedback from demo |        [N]            |  3               | 0.85   | I think I could have seen a few more projects, but I had to leave early because my dad had to leave to pick up my grandparents. I probably could have also tried to put myself out there a bit more when it was my turn to present. So I probably could have engaged a bit more but part of that was due to having to leave early.        |\n",
