    "Over the next few days I worked on making it so when the player gets close to the npc on the map, they will get transported to the corresponding level for the area.\n",
    "\n",
    "I had to create an empty transitionNPCS property in GameControl, and also ended up having to change the way I had the npcs defined in GameLevelMap.\n",

    "\n",
    "Then I had to add the targetLevel property to the sprite data for GameLevelMap, and edit Npc.js so that all Npcs have the targetLevel property. This has the level that the sprite's dimensions/hitbox should trigger the transition to. For this I also had to add a name property to each of the game levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the changes were in GameControl, where transitionNPCS and targetLevel would now be used/referenced.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the new functions I added, handleNPCTransition for the actual level transitions and checkTransitions to see if the player is in the transition areas and then run handleNPCTransition.\n",

    "\n",
    "I also had to add checkTransitions to be used in the gameLoop. I had to do a lot of troubleshooting trying and testing different things before I got it to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "While troubleshooting I had to add to/edit Npc.js in order to resolve the sprites being made twice and to fix the collisions between the player and the npc transition areas which wasn't working before.\n",
    "![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f34f60e-a3c7-466e-8e3a-958d183267dc)\n",
    "Here the npcs now get assigned a new unique id each time they're made, as part of the issue seemed to be because of duplicate ids/objects. As well as the additional hitbox calculations and collision dimensions since the hitbox values had been coming back as 0 before.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also had to do the something similar in Player.js\n",

    "After finishing the transitions from the map/npcs into their corresponding levels, then I worked on being able to go back after completing the quiz from the npc. Originally I was going to do more with the quiz but I ended up opting for something simpler due to time as well as it also seeming more complicated. \n",
    "\n",
    "First I worked on making a function that checked for quiz completion. Before I could do that I had to find a way to track quiz completion. So I created GameState.js\n",

    "Then I could make the checkquizCompletion function in GameControl, which ends the level if the quiz has been submitted.\n",

    "Then I made the routeToMapLevel function to load GameLevelMap after quiz completion.\n",

    "\n",
    "This function just loaded the map level and destroyed the objects from the previous level. In order to have it run after quiz completion I ended up editing the gameLoop.\n",

    "The very last thing I finished changing was simply just adding another browser text prompt at the start of the map level with a bit of guidance/directions on what the player is supposed to do.\n",
